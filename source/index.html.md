L Biglia will miss this game and N Gaitan is the one likely to replace Messi, if necessary. Over the years it has become quite clear that Messi does not reach the same heights playing for Argentina,  as he does playing for Barcelona.</p><p>M Fernandez is injured and he has been replaced by M Gonzalez in the Chilean squad. Key players as always for Chile are of course A Sanchez and A Vidal.</p><p>G Higuain, Kun Aguero, Di Maria, yes,  Argentina have some outstanding offensive players in their team even without L Messi and their midfield line is also top class with E Banega, Mascherano and J Pastore likely starters.</p><p>I would back the Argentinian win.</p>",
